# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This study guide was created to accompany my learning during the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. I built this project as a place to store my notes on HTML,CSS,Git, and JavaScript, as well as to share them publicly for other classmates. This study guide will help me practice building web applications and keep track of my notes as I learn full-stack coding. In building the study guide, I have learned basic HTML framework, CSS styling to customize the user experience, Git flow and repo management, and implemented rudimentary JavaScript functionality to log information to the browser's console.
